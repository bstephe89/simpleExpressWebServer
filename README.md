 What else can you do with Node Packages?
    - node packages can be used for a variety of things. Node.js can be used to handle events, send emails, parse and upload files, interact with a database, etc. Node packages are available to install, or you can create your own to include in your application. They are basically just sets of code organized modularly for easy to understand and effective applications.
 What else can you do with Express?
    - Express is used for request and response, routing, serving static files, etc. It can be used for form submissions, login pages, cookies management, etc.
 What other technologies could you use instead of Express?
    - Other Node.js web frameworks include Adonis.js, Meteor.js, Nest.js, etc. Angular, React, and Vue are also frameworks that can be used depending on the project / application.
 How is hosting in Express different than how you've hosted before?
    - Prior to this class, I have never hosted anything myself. I have typically used third-party online hosting (wix, netlify, etc.). When hosting on my local computer, I have used the default local host and pulled up one page at a time from my project folder.
